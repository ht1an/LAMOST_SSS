this is a introduction file for the code preparing the input catalog for LAMOST SSS.
Here the code main.py is used to read and use the function Inp_cat_output(******,fn)
to save the data into catalog.csv with a certain format.
Except the catalog.csv file, config.ini is also a necessary file for SSS.
